full Calendar:
The calendar is powered by a JQuery plugin called FullCalendar. Full documentation can be found here: http://fullcalendar.io/ (Its the same technology that powers our the Marketing Calendar in our app!)

The calendar gathers its events from a series of Gmail Calendars using Google Calendar's API. As Salesforce calendars all have restricted access we are using a standard gmail account.

The account has 8 calendars that are attached to it, where each has been shared to make the calendar 'public'. More information can be found here: https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37083?hl=en
